# Analyzing-Sentiment-Pattern

## What This Project Is About

  Every day, people tweet their thoughts about products, companies, and experiences. What if we could track these thoughts and understand how the world feels about a brand? That’s what this project aims to do.
  With a little help from pandas, TextBlob, and matplotlib, we:
  Clean and prep real-world tweet data
  Analyze public sentiment trends
  Create easy-to-understand visuals
  Dive deeper into what people are saying about a specific brand

Jupyter Notebook

## Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/brand-sentiment-analysis.git

2. Navigate into the folder:
   cd brand-sentiment-analysis

3. Install dependencies:
   pip install pandas matplotlib textblob

4. Launch the notebook:
   jupyter notebook

## How It Works

This project processes a pre-labeled dataset of tweets to analyze sentiment. Here’s a breakdown:

1. Load the Data:
    Tweets are loaded into a pandas DataFrame.

2. Clean the Data:
   Handle missing values and remove duplicate entries.

3. Explore Sentiments:
   Count how many tweets fall into each sentiment category.

4. Visualize Trends:
   Use bar and pie charts to show sentiment distributions.

5. Brand Focus:
   Zoom into tweets mentioning Microsoft and analyze them separately.

## Usage & Explanation

This notebook is both educational and functional. Here’s a human-friendly explanation of what’s happening:

We start by loading the tweet dataset and adding clear column names.
We clean things up by removing missing or duplicate data.
Then, we count how often each sentiment appears across the whole dataset.
We use a bar chart to make this count easier to understand visually.
Finally, we filter out tweets related to Microsoft and see how its sentiment stacks up with a pie chart.

## Results & Visuals

A bar chart showing the total sentiment distribution across all brands.
A pie chart in see how sentiment varies.

## Credits

Special thanks to the creators of the original labeled tweet dataset. This project also references standard tutorials on pandas and matplotlib to guide the analysis.If you're learning sentiment analysis, this project is a great place to start!
